fulhack t.co/Vt2qCGCSLU - had a go myself on converting your PyMC2 code to PyMC3
fulhack
fulhack But that's cool - I think that for conversion analyses a MCMC approach is great. I am of course a Bayesian so I WOULD say that :)
fulhack Did you not have a look at PyMC3? cc twiecki Cmrn_DP
And I gave Luigi a shoutout in this t.co/8W2wtEeG7A - you might like it - from PyData track in Dublin
fulhack I did some Teichmuller Theory in my Masters - it made me cry :(

barrypj Well we are still seeing an evolution of data frames in Spark and PyData - which seems to be a good abstraction.

tslevi Lidinwise Yeah I know Tommy - I'm with you on this. It is just really hard to stop PR winning over reality.
tslevi Lidinwise And no one cares because they like to sound cool and stuff...
tslevi Lidinwise Yeah I agree. I mean you also have to sometimes understand that people are often inaccurate. e.g. I don't do 'big data'
tslevi Lidinwise Yeah fair enough - that is a useful distinction.
tslevi Lidinwise Word2vec is not deep learning - it's merely branded as that. Lots of data science is about jargon and marketing sadly :)

Lidinwise tslevi I think there is a lot of rebranding like this. I've seen 'Bayesian Statistics' called 'Machine Learning'
oceankidbilly Surely wesmckinn can answer that right?
John4man A useful abbreviation for the inevitable quantitatization (is that a word) of many industries. Which has happened since empiricism
"John4man I think data science is 'just' a thing , otherwise we've taken other industries like OR and Stats under it"
wesmckinn Yeah - I'd agree with that sentiment. The 'great decoupling' right! Do you consider Jupyter an example of this?
jakevdp gmarkall Yeah so it was as simple as I thought :) I'll put together some slides for a lighting talk though :)
wesmckinn I think this is a common conflation. So I assume you think 'data stored in various databases' will stay. Ibis solves the rest?
patio11 If I need to rapidly improve my bizdev skills what would I read from you?

tdhopper treycausey I wish it was just telling a story (goes back to fighting with his slow unvectorized code)
treycausey Yeah fair enough - I think a lot of jobs rebrand as data science. I've seen 'data governance' rebranded as it...
"treycausey I wasn't saying that, I would say though that some roles are very very low on stats and ML."

RachelShadoan Can you send me your email address :)
holdenweb I believe it was actually at the tutorial of PyData Conference. But you mentioned your tutorial.
ianozsvald Much obliged. Nice answers actually I like your 'big data' distinction. The interview set brought that up a lot

DoodlingData BecomingDataSci Yeah agreed. I think Chris is being contrary for the sake of it here.
DoodlingData So I agree with you :)
DoodlingData I think the context that started the tweet was that a young lady with solid software skills was not being taken seriously
DoodlingData And when I taught girls - negative stereotypes were a thing.
DoodlingData Ok fair point. I don't see the harm in it. I do see the harm in saying 'you don't look like a X' to someone.

tslevi i think financial engineering went through the same phases
tslevi the title is cheap so companies are giving it to people

kaythaney But we need to get better - as you pointed out :)
kaythaney But I also realise I have a lot to learn. I'm also proud of how much better than before conferences are.
kaythaney No it is just i am trying a lot. I'm madly in love with a feminist lady. And women in STEM means a lot to me.
segdeha Context is everything. Thanks for the help :)
kaythaney Yeah I get it. Thanks for the clarification.
segdeha Yeah I get that
segdeha I understand your views - i take back what i said...
segdeha Ok I get what you mean...
kaythaney So just so I understand. You dislike the ageism but you're fine with the 'geek crush' thing?
segdeha I don't understand the 'geek crush' thing I think that is fair. But the age thing perhaps is a bad thing...
segdeha Ok. Perhaps 'over' is the wrong word. I apologise.
kaythaney Ok that's fair :)
kaythaney I'm interested to know - I'm oblivious as a white male to my power a lot of the time...
kaythaney But I did get called at a conference 'a geeky crush' by a female member. And I found it flattering. But is that a power thing?
kaythaney It is interesting though. I think we all are very unaware what are the 'microagressions' that we all do.
kaythaney I know though - I used to teach in an all girls school. Compliments were uncomfortable there. I think it is context specific
segdeha Not telling her. Just suspecting... I mean we all overreact to some things... this happens
kaythaney I understand your views. But I suspect you are overreacting perhaps. No?

t.co/l2sdijhwXW - PyCon Ireland needs sponsors :)
DavidMcQueen Yeah I was aware of that reality. I think we'll inevitably have such contractions the challenge is how- the gaps can be filled
DavidMcQueen THAT resourcefulness is what we need to teach. And not let schooling get in the way of their education
DavidMcQueen An old student of mine sent me an email recently. She had taught herself all sorts of things for a job interview.
DavidMcQueen But we can't expect schools to cover everything - even my uni career only taught me a smidgen
"DavidMcQueen Maybe we need more Youth clubs, more things like that. Maybe some of them can be private."
"DavidMcQueen And also a lot of the students I worked with, were fortunate enough to not have guns and drugs surrounding them all the time"
DavidMcQueen I agree David. I used to work in a state school in Northern Ireland. In reality a lot of students were learning from MOOC
Looking forward to speaking at pyconireland this year - I'll be giving two Data Science talks.
In response to cdubhland building a probabilistic model - I just built a stochastic vol model for a market :)

andrew_clegg thalesians And that is the problem - in fact data scientists should probably learn whatever language their dev teams use
andrew_clegg thalesians Yeah I guess that is the best way - working with other Scala programmers. I don't really have a team who uses it
thalesians andrew_clegg I do like the functional programming stuff though - is it Java done right?
thalesians andrew_clegg Just had a play with the REPL for Scala recently. But i imagine writing proper code will be a challenge
thalesians andrew_clegg Never really enjoyed Java but want to take advantage of the JVM
thalesians andrew_clegg How do you recommend someone get started? Scala is always a language I wanted to learn.

treycausey BecomingDataSci But good point on how productive some people are.
treycausey BecomingDataSci Yeah fair point. The delta is very impressive. But I think some of us assume 'if you haven't coded by 12'...

joelgrus Ok agreed. Otherwise it is faith in the ignorance of experts. I have personally looked at the climate change stuff - so convinced
joelgrus Am I talking through my arse?
"joelgrus For example I am a data analyst with a Masters in Mathematics, I do feel qualified to talk about vaccinations being a good idea."
joelgrus I agree with you Joel. But I do think having a Masters in Chemistry probably makes the Pope scientifically literate.
erinshellman I just realized I was interviewing loads and loads of guys...
erinshellman Defo about data science :) I want to hear your views on the data science workflow and how useful stats is :)
jakevdp I'd agree about that for Masters students too say.

ianhuston jonsedar Dask looks very interesting
ianhuston jonsedar And out of core technologies in Python and R are improving too
ianhuston jonsedar agreed about mpps only petabytes are when you need spark or Hadoop
ianhuston jonsedar But it distracted me at the start. And recruiters don't help matters. NoSQL is so nebulous
ianhuston jonsedar This stuff is very distracting though. People use Hadoop and Mongodb as the be all and end all. In reality they arent
ianhuston jonsedar I think SQL and Rdms are still a fine solution up to 1tb say
